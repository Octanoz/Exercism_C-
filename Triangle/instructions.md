# Instructions

Determine if a triangle is `equilateral`, `isosceles`, or `scalene`.

## Rules

- An equilateral triangle has _all three sides the same length_.
- An isosceles triangle has _at least two sides the same length_.
    - (Sometimes specified as exactly two sides the same length, for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two)
- A scalene triangle has _all sides of different lengths_.

#### Note
For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

## Equations

Where a, b, and c are sides of the triangle. Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

$a + b ≥ c$  
$b + c ≥ a$  
$a + c ≥ b$
